##  About Me

I’m passionate about developing solutions that are not just functional — but reliable, clear, and built for growth.
I approach every project as a system: from the UI to the backend to the database. I prioritize modularity, code clarity, and data integrity.

I’m especially driven by working with data — designing robust data models, building meaningful analytics, and turning information into actionable insights.

I’m particularly interested in contributing to fields like healthtech, national infrastructure, data platforms, and defense systems — where code must be robust, secure, and thoughtful.
