## 🌟 About Me

I'm passionate about developing solutions that are not just functional — but **reliable, clear, and built for growth**.  
I approach every project as a system: from the UI to the backend to the database. I prioritize **modularity, code clarity, and data integrity**.

I'm especially interested in contributing to fields like **healthtech, national infrastructure, data platforms, and defense systems** — where code must be robust, secure and thoughtful.
